/**
  * An implementation of [[StructMapper]] that will align an input
  * record so that it's structure matches that defined in the metastore.
  *
  * Sometimes an input record will not contain a value for a field defined
  * by the metastore schema. If the metastore field has a default value
  * or allows nulls, then output record could be padded to include that field.
  *
  * Secondly, the input record may specify extra fields which are not required
  * by the hive table. Therefore these records can be safely dropped.
  *
  * Lastly, for file formats that do not include field information, such as
  * CSV without headers, the field orderings must match the hive metastore.
  * An input record may include all the required fields but in a different
  * order, and so this transformer can reorder the fields as required.
